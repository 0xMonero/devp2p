# DEVP2P PROPOSALS

This folder is where drafts and proposals may be submitted.

These are organised by protocol categories, such as light-clients protocols, consensus and discovery.

Documents are preferred in markdown format while discussion can take place around these either as github issues or reviews.

Proposals should start with a brief overview summarising and identifying the document.

Finalised proposals will be archived to provide context for any resulting changes to protocols. Finalised draft protocol specs are either rejected or moved to their corresponding folder of current specifications.
